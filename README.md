# Skeleton-Decomposition-of-Tensors

An attempt to code the Skeleton Decomposition Algorithm for Tensor Approximation/Decomposition

skeletonDecomp.m - Actual implementation of Algorithm for equidimensional two-dimensional tensor

skeletonDecompMatUneven.m - Implementation of Algorithm for rectangular two-dimensional tensor

svdNorms.m - Computes SVD of a matrix for different ranks and outputs a list of the Norms

skeleton_svd_comparision.m - Outputs the time taken for running svdNorms.m and skeletonDecomp.m on a given Matrix

maxvol2.m - Computes the sub matrix of a given one using maximum subvolume algorithm (File given by Prof. Kishore Kumar)
